    "Text classification is part of supervised Machine Learning (ML). As depicted in the picture above, supervised ML relies on labeled data - not only for training, but also for model testing. It is important that training- and test-datasets are disjoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a model is trained, it is applied on test-data and calculates predictions for the test-data input. Since for test-data also the true label (output) is known, these true labels can be compared with the predicted labels. Based on this comparison, different  **metrics** for classifier evaluations can be calculated. The most important classifier metrics are described below."
