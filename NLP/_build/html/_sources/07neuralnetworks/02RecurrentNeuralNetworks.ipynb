    "In artificial neural networks the neurons are typically arranged in layers. There exist weighted connections between the neurons in different layers. The weights are learned during the training-phase and define the overall function $f$, which maps an input-signal $\\mathbf{x}$ to an output $\\mathbf{y}$. In a feed-forward network the neural layers are  ordered such that the signals of the input-neurons are connected to the input of the neurons in the first hidden layer. The output of the neurons in the $i.th$ hidden layer are connected to the input of the neurons in the $(i+1).th$ hidden layer and so on. The output of the neurons in the last hidden layer, are connected to the neurons in the output layer. In particular there are no backward-connections in a feed-forward network. A multilayer-perceptron (MLP) is a feed-forward network in which all neurons in layer $i$ are connected to all neurons in layer $i+1$. A simple MLP with 3 input neurons, one hidden layer and one neuron in the output layer is depicted in figure below. "

    "Simple RNNs, as described and depicted in [Simple RNN](#abstrnn), suffer from an important problem: Applying Stochastic Gradient Descent allows to learn short-term dependencies quite well, but the network is not capable to learn long-term dependencies. The reason for this drawback is the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem): In SGD weights are updated proportional to the gradient of the loss-function with respect to the specific weight. In some areas of the networks these gradients get marginal, i.e. the weights are not adapted any longer. S. Hochreiter and J. Schmidhuber studied the problem of vanishing gradients in simple RNNs in their famous paper [Long short-term Memory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory) and they proposed a new type of RNN, which circumvents this problem and is able to learn also long-term dependencies.
