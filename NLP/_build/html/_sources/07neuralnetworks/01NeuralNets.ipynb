    "Neurons are the basic elements for information processing. A neuron consists of a cell-body, many dendrites and an axon. The neuron receives electrical signals from other neurons via the dendrites. In the cell-body all input-signals received via the dendrites are accumulated. If the accumulated electrical signal exceeds a certain threshold, the cell-body outputs an electrical signal via it's axon. In this case the neuron is said to be activated. Otherwise, if the accumulated input at the cell-body is below the threshold, the neuron is not active, i.e. it does not send a signal to connected neurons. The point, where dendrites of neurons are connected to axons of other neurons is called synapse. The synapse consists of an electrochemical substance. The conductivity of this substance depends on it's concentration of neurotransmitters. The process of learning adapts the conductivity of synapses and, i.e. the degree of connection between neurons. A single neuron can receive inputs from 10-100000 other neurons. However, there is only one axon, but multiple dendrites of other cell can be connected to this axon.   "

Each Neural Network has at least one input-layer and one output-layer. The number of neurons in the input-layer is determined by the number of features (attributes) in the given Machine-Learning problem. The number of neurons in the output-layer depends on the task. E.g. for **binary-classification** and **regression** only one neuron in the output-layer is requried, for classification into $K>2$ classes the output-layer consists of $K$ neurons.\n",

Moreover, in section [Concept of Learning](#learnconcept) the general idea of training a Neural Network has been presented. Now, a concrete realization of this general idea is presented - **Gradient Descent -** and **Stochastic Gradient Descent Learning**. This approach is not only applied for all types of Neural Networks, but for many other supervised Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Descent Learning\n",
    "The concept of Gradient Descent Learning is as follows:\n",
    "1. Define a **Loss Function** $E(T,\\Theta)$, which somehow measures the deviation between the current network $\\mathbf{y}$ output and the target output $\\mathbf{r}$. As above, \n",

A small $\\eta$ implies that weights are adapted only slightly per iteration and the learning algorithm converges slowly. A large learning-rate implies strong adaptations per iteration. However, in this case the risk of *jumping over the minimum* is increased. Typical values for $\\eta$ are in the range of $[0.0001,0.1]$.  "
