Custom Package Repositories in R
by Steve Belcher, Sr Technical Specialist, Microsoft Data & AI In some companies, R users can’t download R packages from CRAN.

Create and deploy a Custom Vision predictive service in R with AzureVision
The AzureVision package is an R frontend to Azure Computer Vision and Azure Custom Vision. These services let you leverage Microsoft’s Azure cloud to carry out visual recognition tasks using advanced image processing models, with minimal machine learning expertise. The basic idea behind Custom Vision is to take a pre-built image recognition model supplied by Azure, and customise it for your needs by supplying a set of images with which to update it. All model training and prediction is done in the cloud, so you don’t need a powerful machine of your own. Similarly, since you are starting with a...
 
AzureQstor: R interface to Azure Queue Storage now on GitHub

A single queue message can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account. Queue storage is often used to create a backlog of work to process...
 
R 4.0.0 now available, and a look back at R's history

As the version number bump suggests, this is a major update to R that makes some significant changes. Some of these changes — particularly the first one listed below — are likely to affect the results of R's calculations, so I would not recommend running scripts written for prior versions of R without validating them first. In any case, you'll need to reinstall any packages you were using for R 4.0.0. (You might find this R script useful for...
