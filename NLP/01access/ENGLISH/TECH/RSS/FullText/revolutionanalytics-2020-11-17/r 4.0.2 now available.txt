R 4.0.2 is now available for download for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms. This update addresses a few minor bugs included in the R 4.0.0 release, and also a significant bug introduced in R 4.0.1 on the Windows platform. Compared to R 4.0.0, the R 4.0.2 update also improves the performance of the merge function, and adds an option to better handle zero-length arguments to the paste and paste0 functions. For the details on the changes in R 4.0.2 follow the link below, and visit your local CRAN mirror to download the update.R-announce mailing list: R 4.0.2 is released

It's almost a month since the last update. Is it still being developed or has it entered testing already?
