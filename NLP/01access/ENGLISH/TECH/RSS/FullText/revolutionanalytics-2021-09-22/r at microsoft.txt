I was my great pleasure yesterday to be a presenter in the "Why R Webinar" series, on the topic R at Microsoft. In the talk (which you can watch below) I recounted the history of Microsoft's acquisition of Revolution Analytics, and the various way the Microsoft supports R: its membership of the R Consortium, integration with many products (including demos of Azure ML Service with GitHub Actions, and Azure Functions), and how Microsoft has driven adoption of R in large organizations by making R "IT approved". Many thanks to the Why R Foundation for hosting the talk, and to everyone who asked questions and prompted a lively discussion at the end:You can also find links and resources associated with the talk, including the slides, at the GitHub repository linked below.GitHub (revodavid): R at Microsoft
