Microsoft365R 2.1.0 with Outlook support now on CRANI’m happy to announce that Microsoft365R 2.1.0 is now on CRAN with Outlook email support! Here’s a quick summary of the new features:Here’s a sample of how to write an email using blastula:And on the other side, here’s a sample of how to work with the emails in your inbox:In addition, this release fixes a bug in the list_files() method for OneDrive/Sharepoint drives and drive items, and adds the ability to create nested drive folders in one call.Please note that if you’re using one of the workarounds mentioned in the authentication vignette, they won’t work with Outlook. You’ll need to get the Microsoft365R app approved for your tenant, or alternatively, if you have admin rights you can create your own tenant with the required permissions. (This applies if you’re using Microsoft365R at work; if you’re using it at home on your personal account, you shouldn’t have any problems.)If you have any feedback or comments, you can email me or open an issue at the repo.
