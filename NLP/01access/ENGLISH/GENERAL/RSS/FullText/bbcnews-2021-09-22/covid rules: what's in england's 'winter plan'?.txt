Covid rules: What's in England's 'Winter Plan'?Measures to deal with rising Covid cases in England over the winter have been announced - with a contingency "Plan B" if things get worse.Single vaccines will be offered to children aged 12-15 and booster jabs to over-50s, health workers and the most vulnerable. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have confirmed they will offer the same. It's called the Covid-19 Response: Autumn and Winter Plan. Covid booster jabs will be offered to around 30 million people, including the over-50s, younger adults with health conditions and frontline health and social care workers.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Plan A would also include offering vaccines to youngsters aged 12-15 and continuing to encourage unvaccinated people to get jabbed.If Plan A is not sufficient to prevent "unsustainable pressure" on the NHS, the government says Plan B will be required "as a last resort" - including: Plan B could be brought in at short notice as a response to "concerning" data. Government scientific advisers haven't said exactly what this data would be, but say it's important to keep an eye on: Prime Minister Boris Johnson said parts of Plan B could be introduced gradually, rather than all at once.
