Mexican Alvarez, 31, shoved Plant in the chest, sending the unbeaten American staggering across the stage.Alvarez then evaded a punch from Plant before landing two of his own to cut the 29-year-old under his right eye.The fight takes place in Las Vegas on 6 November.Alvarez is the current WBC, WBA and WBO title holder, having beaten British boxers Callum Smith and Billy Joe Saunders to win the belts, while Plant holds the IBF version.When the pair came out again at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills following their initial altercation, Plant accused Alvarez of being a "drug cheat", a reference to Alvarez's positive test for a banned steroid in 2018."Don't make excuses before the fight," responded Alvarez, who has lost just once in 59 professional fights.He also claimed the brawl had been instigated by Plant insulting his mother. "He can say whatever he wants to me, but not to my mum," Alvarez said. "He swung, I just pushed him."Tennessee native Plant, who holds a 21-0 record, aimed a left hook at Alvarez after he was pushed and blamed the melee on his rival. "All we was doing was staring at each other. He had something to say, I had something to say. He's going to beat me, I'm going beat him," he said.County Championship final round - day twoThe toxic battle ripping Barcelona apartWatch: Road Cycling World Championships - GB in mixed team time trialRelaunching a career after prison?With Digga D's music rigorously policed, he has everything to fight for and to loseThe Ryder Cup captains' picks analysedMark Chapman is joined by Iain Carter and Paul Waring to discuss selectionsThe toxic battle ripping Barcelona apartHow Europe’s ‘buzz’ culture has brought Ryder Cup successWhy England pulling out of Pakistan tour is such a disappointment'We have no excuse now' - how Brighton are building for WSL success on and off pitchWatch: Jones scores four touchdowns in Packers win'The wait for Ryder Cup week is over - bring it on''Millimetres away from gold!'
