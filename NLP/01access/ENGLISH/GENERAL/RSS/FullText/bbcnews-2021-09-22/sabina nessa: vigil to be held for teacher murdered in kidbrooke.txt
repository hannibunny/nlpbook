Sabina Nessa: Vigil to be held for teacher murdered in KidbrookeA vigil will be held on Friday in memory of a primary school teacher killed in a south-east London park.The body of Sabina Nessa, 28, was found by a member of the public in Cator Park, Kidbrooke, on Saturday morning. Met Police believe she was attacked and died the previous evening, at a time when the park would have been busy.Information sheets advising women on how to stay safe at night have been handed out by a community group in response to the death.The handout suggests pedestrians stick to busy places with good lighting.Advice on the sheet, printed from the Met Police website, also includes the suggestions that pedestrians should face oncoming traffic and conceal their jewellery.The area where the 28-year-old was found remains cordoned off and flowers have been left at the site.A post-mortem examination into the cause of Ms Nessa's death was inconclusive, Met Police said.A man in his 40s arrested on suspicion of murder has been released under further investigation.Miss Nessa, who lived in Lewisham, south-east London, with her father, had been the year one teacher at Rushey Green Primary school in Catford for about a year.Officers have asked for any potential witnesses to contact them, and for drivers to check dash-cam footage they might have.Met Police believe the attack happened around 20:30 BST on 17 September at a time where the park "was likely being used by many people."Det Supt Luke Marks said: "This did not happen in the middle of the night - people would have been in and around the park at the time."We have extra officers in the area conducting high-visibility patrols, and anybody in London, regardless of gender, should be able to go out in an evening and not be concerned about being the victim of violent crime."Ms Nessa was described by colleagues as "kind, caring and dedicated". The school's headteacher Lisa Williams said: "She had so much life ahead of her and so much more to give and her loss is desperately sad."As a school we are supporting each other through this very difficult time, and we will be providing specialist support to those who need it."Murdered teacher's body found hours after attackTeacher found dead near community centre namedMurder probe after woman's body found in GreenwichWoman in critical condition after being stabbed near Barnet HospitalEaling Tesco shoppers thanked by charities for feeding childrenNew partner helps secure future of Ealing Half MarathonMayoral elections to change to first past the postLeyton man who saved a dog from meat trade to run marathonViolent burglars who attacked 98-year-old war veteran remain at largeInformation about BBC links to other news sitesUK recognises Covishield but confusion over travellersPeople vaccinated in India may still have to isolate for 10 days on arrival when UK rules change next monthUK PM to Macron: Donnez-moi un break over new pactTrump sues niece and NY Times over tax storyCould 241m vaccine doses go to waste?Life at 50C: Heat hitting home in Australia.
