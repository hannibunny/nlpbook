Harry Dunn: Liz Truss raises case with US at United Nations AssemblyForeign Secretary Liz Truss has raised the case of Harry Dunn with the US Secretary of State during the United Nations General Assembly.Mr Dunn, 19, was killed when his motorbike was hit by a car driven by US citizen Anne Sacoolas in 2019. The Foreign Office said Ms Truss spoke to Antony Blinken about "delivering justice for Harry's family".Mr Dunn's mum Charlotte Charles said: "It means the world to us to see Harry remains at the top of the agenda."It is alleged Mrs Sacoolas's car struck the teenager's motorbike moments after she left RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, in 2019, where her husband Jonathan worked for a US intelligence agency.She had diplomatic immunity asserted on her behalf following the crash and left the UK.Mrs Sacoolas was charged in the UK with causing death by dangerous driving, but an extradition request submitted by the Home Office was rejected by the US State Department in January last year.The Dunn family is pursuing a civil claim against her.Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said: "It is over two years since Harry died and almost two years to the day since Harry's family were told by Northamptonshire Police that they had less than one per cent chance of having anyone held accountable for his death, which led the family to start their campaign for justice."We are grateful to Dominic Raab and the excellent officials at the FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) for everything they have done in pressing the the US government to reverse this denial of justice and I look forward to talking to Liz Truss later today to see where we are up to."Words are all well and good but it is high time that justice is now delivered."Ms Charles said "Harry would be so proud" to be at the forefront of the foreign secretary's mind."We continue to suffer and miss Harry every single day," she said."We feel we are just existing at the moment and I would just ask the officials in both London and Washington to do all they can to help my family get justice for Harry as soon as possible please."Ms Truss raised the matter with Mr Blinken during a discussion around a range of issues. Those included UK and US ambitions to build a stronger economic and security alliance, security in the Indo-Pacific and the lifting of travel restrictions on fully-vaccinated travellers from the UK to America.A FCDO spokesperson said: "The Foreign Secretary also raised the case of Harry Dunn and the need to make progress on delivering justice for Harry's family."Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
