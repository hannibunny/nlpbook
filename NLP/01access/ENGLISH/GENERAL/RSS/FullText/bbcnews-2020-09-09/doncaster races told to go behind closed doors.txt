"We do, of course, fully understand and respect the decision and will be contacting all of our customers booked for the remaining three days as a matter of urgency."The government said on Tuesday night that social gatherings in England would reduce from a maximum of 30 to six people from Monday in response to rising numbers of coronavirus cases.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said more details will be announced on Wednesday."The Prime Minister is going to set out more details on the consequences of new rules for six people gathering later today. We'll set out what this means for some of these events we were planning to do," he told BBC Breakfast.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to expand on the new rules at a Downing Street news conference at 16:00 BST, where he will be joined by Professor Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser.Doncaster mayor Ros Jones had said the risk of holding the fixture with crowds was "too great" and welcomed the reversal."I believe holding the St Leger Festival behind closed doors is the right thing to do for the safety of the borough, given the latest change in Government's advice overnight and the increase in infection rates both in Doncaster and nationally," said the mayor."I welcome this decision and as I have said consistently that the risks were too great for Doncaster."Racing has been held behind closed doors since resuming on 1 June after a 10-week suspension because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Up to 3,640 people will be permitted entry on Wednesday, and the racecourse says more than 2,500 tickets have been sold. A limit of 6,202 was planned on the other days, including Saturday, when the Leger - the world's oldest Classic race - is staged.Spectators had to sign up to a code of conduct and have been split into dedicated zones, with social distancing protocols in place.More than 54,000 spectators attended the four-day meeting last year, including 27,000 on the Saturday.A trial attendance of 5,000 people was due to take place on the fifth and final day of Glorious Goodwood last month, but that was scrapped at the last minute after a spike in coronavirus cases across parts of Britain.Premier League transfers latestTour de France - can Bennett win again on stage 11?Bob Willis Trophy: Somerset reach final - day four radio & textExtinction: The Facts with Sir David AttenboroughWhat does the crisis mean for us?How to get into horse riding, whether you want to work with horses at the stables or become a fully fledged jockey.Latest updates and video from the world of equestrian sportsHow to watch, listen to & follow every Premier League gameQ&A: What will the 2020-21 season look like?Rate this summer's Premier League signingsKohli living in luxury & Gayle 'ready for school' - IPL socialMeet Australia's whisky-loving vegan who packs a microwave in his suitcaseWatch: 'Out of this world' PFA award winner De Bruyne's best momentsWatch the best bits of the 2019 NFL season'Disqualified Djokovic will win again - hopefully with a little more humility'Renewals, refunds, credits & ballots - what's happening with Premier League season tickets?'Brutally honest' Squad Goals reveals harsh reality of women's footballBBC Three starts a second season of their documentary series following West Ham Women.Protest, defiance and the arena: How sport stood up for black livesAdam Yates' Tour de France stage-by-stage guide
