COP26: China's Xi Jinping unlikely to attend, UK PM toldBy James LandaleDiplomatic correspondentUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been warned by officials that China's President Xi Jinping is unlikely to attend the COP26 climate summit in November.

It is thought he has not left China since early 2020.Government sources said Chinese officials had not been definitive about the President's travel plans and they accepted it was possible Xi could change his mind and come at the last minute to surprise the summit. "They want to be seen as green leaders so I wouldn't rule it out," one Whitehall source said. Diplomats said China often announced President Xi's travel plans at the last minute. One said: "We never give up hope. And we are continuing to make the case for his personal attendance."In September, Chinese officials told Italian diplomats that President Xi did not plan to attend a meeting of G20 leaders in Rome on October 30 which immediately precedes the COP26 summit. They cited China's Covid regulations as the reason. Western diplomats said there were genuine concerns among Chinese officials at being able to protect Mr Xi from Covid outside China. On 19 September, the UK COP President Alok Sharma told the BBC's Andrew Marr show there was uncertainty about President Xi's attendance: "The issue of whether President Xi Jinping is going to come, that's not yet been confirmed."On Friday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed he would attend the conference.
