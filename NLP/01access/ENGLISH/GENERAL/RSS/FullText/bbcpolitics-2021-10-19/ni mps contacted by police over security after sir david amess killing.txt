NI MPs contacted by police over security after Sir David Amess killingMPs in Northern Ireland have been contacted by the Police Service of Northern Ireland's chief constable following the killing of Sir David Amess.The Conservative MP died after being stabbed at his constituency surgery in Essex.His death has raised fresh concerns over the safety of politicians.Justice Minister Naomi Long said Simon Byrne had contacted MPs to discuss their security.Meanwhile police confirmed they were contacted after a group of anti-vaccine protestors turned up at Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon's constituency office, as first reported by the Sunday Independent.The SDLP deputy leader told BBC News NI her staff were "harassed and intimidated".Acting ACC Melanie Jones said the contacting of MPs by officers was part of Operation Bridger, which was set up after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016.It was designed to give MPs access to extra security for their homes and offices, but there is now likely to be a push to ensure all forces are fully on board with it."We are in the process of contacting our local assembly members and will continue to support them by providing crime prevention and personal security advice on an ongoing basis," she said."We encourage all our elected representatives to immediately report any security concerns to police in order to keep themselves, their staff and members of the public attending surgeries safe."Mrs Long said she understood councillors would also be contacted.Speaking on BBC Northern Ireland's Sunday Politics programme, the Alliance Party leader said there was a "tension" as politicians sought to strike a balance between security and accessibility to their constituents."As elected representatives we want to be approachable and I think it is very difficult to balance that against trying to protect yourself, your staff and other people," she said.East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson told Sunday Politics he and other colleagues had been contacted on Saturday about their security by a number of senior police officers.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician said there was an "incredible tension" for politicians who needed to maintain relationships with their constituents by being in public while maintaining their security."As an MP you can't confine yourself," he said."There is nothing that can reach full security and to try to get to that point erects a huge barrier between you and your constituents."He is being held under the Terrorism Act and officers have until Friday to question him.MP reveals death threats after naming Soldier FPolish PM accuses EU of blackmail in law rowMateusz Morawiecki clashes with EU leaders over a Polish court ruling that rejected parts of EU law.Taliban urged to lift ban on girls' education.
