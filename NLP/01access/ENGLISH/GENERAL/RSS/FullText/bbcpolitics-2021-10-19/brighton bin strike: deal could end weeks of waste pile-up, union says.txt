Brighton bin strike: Deal could end weeks of waste pile-up, union saysA last-ditch deal could bring an end to Brighton's bin strike, a union has said.GMB and council officials spent most of Sunday thrashing out a new agreement amid the increasingly bitter row over bin lorry drivers' pay.If members approve the deal, 30 days of industrial action due to launch on Thursday would be cancelled.As both sides met, private firms were called in to tackle piles of street rubbish dumped in the past fortnight.Gary Palmer, GMB organiser, said the agreement between Brighton & Hove City Council and the union could take effect from Tuesday if it is signed off."If the agreement is passed by both parties, GMB will immediately suspend 30 days of strike action due to start on October 21." Mountains of waste have accumulated around the city for almost two weeks amid attempts to end the dispute. Brighton & Hove City Council said it had only called in third parties as blocked pavements and vermin became a "growing and serious" health issue.It said fires had been started in some communal bins over recent days, and pedestrians were increasingly at risk as more waste was dumped on pavements.The Green-led authority met union officials as both sides attempted to agree a formal resolution in the row over changes to driver rounds and pay.A spokesperson said the council respected the decision by some of its Cityclean staff to strike, and it was "keen to address the issues raised" in order to "get the city clean as soon as possible". The council said it was putting forward a "significant and generous pay offer, benefiting some of the lowest paid staff across the whole council, as well as the Cityclean service".GMB organiser Mr Palmer had previously said Sunday's talks could usher in the start of city-wide rubbish clearance.A planned break in the strike is due to take place between Monday and Wednesday, allowing some rubbish to be collected.Meanwhile, GMB General Secretary Gary Smith has called for a Brighton City Councillor to be sacked for comparing striking workers to terrorists.  In a meeting last week, Conservative councillor Joe Miller said: "I hate to refer to Maggie Thatcher, but this is a similar situation - you can't negotiate with terrorists."Mr Smith has written to the joint chairmen of the Conservative Party - Ben Elliot and Oliver Dowden MP - calling for Councillor Miller to be removed from the party.Mr Miller previously said he would not be "bullied" by the GMB.
