Covid-19: New allergic reactions to hair dye reportedHairdressers in parts of the UK are reporting clients having new allergic reactions, like rashes and burns, to hair dye after contracting coronavirus. Scientists at Imperial College London are now researching how the disease could be reprogramming our immune system, in a similar way to other illnesses. The trade body that represents hairdressers and beauticians is warning professionals to carry out additional patch tests to avoid facing legal action. Gemma suffered a reaction to a patch test despite using the same hair dye for years. She had also recovered from a previous Covid infection. Her salon says it has seen four clients with the same issue since it began compulsory patch tests for all clients.Salons report new allergic reactions to hair dye.
