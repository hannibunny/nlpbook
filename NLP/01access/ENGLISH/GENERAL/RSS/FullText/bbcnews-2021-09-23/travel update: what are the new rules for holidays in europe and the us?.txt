Travel update: What are the new rules for holidays in Europe and the US?Eight more countries have moved off the UK's red travel list.Meanwhile, the US will let fully vaccinated travellers from the UK - and many other countries - visit from November.Which countries have moved from red to amber?Bangladesh, Egypt, Kenya, the Maldives, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Turkey are now amber-list countries. They had been red.This means non-UK citizens or residents can now enter the UK without having to pay for hotel quarantine.Aren't more changes on the way?The red lists are remaining, but from 04:00 BST on Monday 4 October, the amber and green lists for travel to England, Scotland and Northern Ireland will merge into a single "rest of world" category.Wales hasn't yet said whether it will do the same.What will the rules be on the "rest of world" list?You will still need to check entry requirements for your destination before you travel. Fully vaccinated travellers returning to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days before coming home.They will still have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. However, from later in October, they'll be able to take a cheaper and simpler lateral flow test instead - hopefully "for when people return from half-term breaks", says the UK government.People who are not fully vaccinated will still need a pre-departure test and a PCR test on days two and eight after they return. They must also self-isolate for 10 days.Most private providers charge above £60 for PCR tests and £30 for lateral flows. Test to Release will remain an option for unvaccinated passengers who want to shorten quarantine.What about Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland?Scotland and Northern Ireland have agreed to adopt the rest of world list but they haven't confirmed whether the current testing rules will change.Wales also hasn't yet announced testing changes.What will count as fully vaccinated?Only people jabbed through an approved vaccination programme in the UK, Europe, USA (or the UK vaccine programme overseas) - or by a similar public health body in 18 other countries (including Israel, Australia or New Zealand) - can avoid quarantine from 4 October.Other versions of the AstraZeneca vaccine - including Indian-made Covishield - qualify as approved vaccines, although India has not been placed on the list of 18 countries.From November, fully vaccinated UK passengers can travel to the US. This should include people who've had the AstraZeneca jab, although the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to make a final decision..Visitors will need to take part in testing and contact tracing.At present, only US citizens, residents and foreigners with special visas can enter from most European countries.What are the current amber-list rules?Most countries are on the amber list.Under-18s and adults who were fully vaccinated in the UK, the US and most European countries don't have to self-isolate upon arrival in the UK. Unvaccinated adults must self-isolate for 10 days.In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, under-11s don't have to test before travel, but do need to take one two days after arrival. Under-5s don't need to test.In Scotland, children over 12 must test before returning home, and again on day two. Nobody has to self-isolate upon return, unless they test positive/develop symptoms.Red-list countries are those the UK government says should not be visited "except in the most extreme of circumstances".If you have been in one in the last 10 days, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national, or UK resident.
