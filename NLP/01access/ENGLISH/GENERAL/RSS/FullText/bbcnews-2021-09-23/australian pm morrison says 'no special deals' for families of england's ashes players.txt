Ashes: Scott Morrison says 'no special deals' for England familiesLast updated on 3 hours ago3 hours ago.From the section CricketAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says there will be "no special deals" after Boris Johnson asked for families of England cricketers to be allowed to travel for the Ashes.The first Test begins on 8 December but some England players are considering pulling out as a result of Australia's strict Covid-19 travel protocols.The country plans to ease restrictions once 80% of adults are vaccinated.Morrison says that figure will reach 50% this week.UK Prime Minister Johnson discussed the issue with Morrison at a dinner in Washington."I would love to see the Ashes go ahead, as I shared with Boris last night," Morrison said.external-link"But there's no special deals there, because what we're looking to have is vaccinated people being able to travel."I don't see a great deal of difference in skilled workers or students who will be able to come to Australia when you reach those vaccination rates. "Those who are coming for that purpose when it comes to their profession, which is playing cricket, I don't see the difference between that and someone who's coming as a skilled, qualified engineer or someone who's coming to be ready for study."Johnson had said: "I raised it and he said he was going to do his best for the families. He merely undertook to come back and see if he could find a solution."The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is expecting details from Cricket Australia on how the series will take place - including quarantine arrangements, provisions for families and if players will have to live in a 'bubble' environment - this week.That information will then be presented to the England players, who will make individual decisions on their participation before the Ashes squad is announced in the first week of October.Even if Australia's travel restrictions change, some states may keep their borders shut for longer which could further complicate the tour given the five Tests take place in five different states.While the dates for the five Tests - between 8 December and 18 January - are not thought to be at risk of being changed, venues could be altered, depending on state-to-state travel restrictions.EFL Cup reaction - West Ham beat Man Utd; Chelsea & Tottenham win on penaltiesCounty Championship - Hants set Lancs 196 to winGatland's selections 'not based on form'What can you do with overripe bananas?Here are some hacks for using up this versatile fruit even if they've been out too longIntroducing you to Marvel's latest hero...Simu Liu reveals all things Shang-Chi to Ali Plumb'It's been a long time waiting' - everything you need to know about 43rd Ryder CupThe toxic battle ripping Barcelona apart'Moliwood' magic & 'Postman' Poulter - what happened at last Ryder Cup?Pick your Chelsea & Man City combined XIMaddison shares 'humble brag' about meeting Jay-ZWhy England pulling out of Pakistan tour is such a disappointment'We have no excuse now' - how Brighton are building for WSL success on and off pitchWatch: Jones scores four touchdowns in Packers win'Millimetres away from gold!'
