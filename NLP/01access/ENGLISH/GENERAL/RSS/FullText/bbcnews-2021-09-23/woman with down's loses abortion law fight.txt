Woman with Down's loses abortion law fightA woman with Down's syndrome has lost her High Court challenge against the government over a law that allows abortion up to birth for a foetus with the condition.Heidi Crowter, 26, from Coventry, brought the case saying the legislation did not respect her life.Her lawyers had argued the rules were unlawfully discriminatory. But two senior judges dismissed the case and concluded the legislation was not unlawful.Under current legislation for England, Wales and Scotland, there is a 24-week time limit for abortion, unless "there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped", which includes Down's syndrome.The judges ruled the law aimed to strike a balance between the rights of the unborn child and of women.Ms Crowter, who is married and campaigns under her maiden name, tweeted after the court's ruling to say she was upset not to win "but the fight is not over".She said: "The judges might not think it discriminates against me, the government might not think it discriminates against me, but I am telling you I feel discriminated against."This is a very sad day, but I will keep fighting.Lord Justice Singh and Mrs Justice Lieven said at the outset of their judgement: "The issues which have given rise to this claim are highly sensitive and sometimes controversial.""This court cannot enter into those controversies; it must decide the case only in accordance with the law."At the hearing in July, the government said there was no evidence abortion law discriminated against Down's.But speaking in July, Ms Crowter said the law was offensive, and she wanted to challenge people's perception of Down's syndrome so that they saw "just a normal person".She also said in the summer her stance was not a campaign against women's right to choose.'Abortion law for Down's doesn't respect my life''See the person behind the extra chromosome'Down's syndrome abortion case heads to High CourtBusting myths about Down's syndromeHundreds watch campaigner's wedding live streamDown's syndrome abortions 'need 24-week limit'Down's syndrome is 'not something to fear'New 'Cafe on the Green' opened at Coventry's Finham Community LibraryRecap: Four car crash on M6 causing eight miles of queuesHinckley-based Avro Energy ceases trading as gas supply crisis deepensWarwickshire needs to step up fight against climate change warn GreensFamily pay tribute to daughter who died in crash'In The City' - Free extravaganza to celebrate the contribution refugees and migrants have made to CoventryInformation about BBC links to other news sitesFrance and US seek to mend rift over Aukus pactThe deal caused outrage in France, which lost a contract to build submarines for Australia.Covid could be more like cold by spring - expertWhat will Germans miss about Angela Merkel?
