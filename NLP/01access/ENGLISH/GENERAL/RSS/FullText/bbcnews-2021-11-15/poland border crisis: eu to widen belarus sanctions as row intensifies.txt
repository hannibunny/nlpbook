Poland border crisis: EU to widen Belarus sanctions as row intensifiesThe European Union will step up sanctions against Belarus and those closest to its leader in response to an escalating migrant crisis at its border with Poland, officials say.The sanctions could target anyone involved in trafficking migrants through Belarus, the EU officials said.The EU has accused Belarus of pushing migrants towards its eastern borders to undermine security, a charge it denies.On Monday, hundreds of migrants were blocked at a crossing by Polish troops.A video filmed at the border by the BBC showed migrants sitting down on a road in front of barbed wire and Polish forces in a tense stand-off.Those migrants came from a large make-shift camp at the Kuznica crossing, where thousands have settled in tents just inside Belarus. They are trapped between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other.The Polish border guard said it expected a forced attempt to breach the border, describing the presence of the Belarusian forces in the area as "worrying".Since the summer thousands of people, mostly from Iraq, Syria and Yemen, have amassed at Belarus's western border with Poland, enduring freezing conditions in the hope of crossing into the EU.The EU has accused Belarus of mounting a "hybrid attack" by encouraging thousands of people to cross into Poland and other members states.Polish troops have gathered to block them @BBCWorld pic.twitter.com/dhSeS11CCuEuropean officials have implicated Belarus's authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, in a scheme to entice migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU.Mr Lukashenko has repeatedly denied that Belarus is sending migrants over the border in revenge for existing EU sanctions. Those sanctions were imposed in June following the arrest of an opposition activist on board a Ryanair flight that was forced to land in Belarus. EU-Belarus relations have been severely strained since Mr Lukashenko declared victory in a disputed presidential election last year before crushing dissenting voices.A stand-off with no end in sightThere were tense scenes here this morning.Just minutes ago, hundreds of people came from a migrant camp up the road and pushed their way through some gates. They're now sitting right next to the checkpoint on the Belarusian side of the border.And from what we saw, the Belarusian forces made no attempt at all to stop them.The migrants are sitting down and are determined to get what they want, which is to be allowed into Poland and therefore the EU.This is a stand-off, with migrants sat on one side and, on the other side of some razor wire, there are lines of Polish police.There is also a Polish helicopter overhead and a water cannon deployed nearby. It is a tense situation and it unclear how it will end.EU foreign ministers are meeting on Monday in Brussels to discuss the new sanctions. The package could include sanctions against officials within Mr Lukashenko's inner circle, and airlines and travel agencies that are flying migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere to Minsk.Ahead of the meeting, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said airlines taking migrants to Belarus could be banned from landing in the EU. Mr Maas warned that the EU was far from the end of the spiral of sanctions it could impose.The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, confirmed stopping the flow of flights carrying migrants was one solution that was being worked on. "From the point of view of the inflow, things are coming under control," Mr Borrell said.On Monday, Mr Lukashenko threatened to retaliate against fresh sanctions. He claimed Belarusian authorities were trying to repatriate stranded migrants but many were refusing to go.Iraq has said it is organising repatriation flights for Iraqi nationals from Belarus, while the United Arab Emirates said it had barred Afghan, Syrian, Yemeni and Iraqi citizens from flights to Minsk.In other developments on Monday: To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Belarus threatens to cut off gas to EU in border rowPutin warns Belarus over gas threat to EuropeTurkey pulls Belarus flights to ease migrant crisisUK hospital car blast declared a terror incidentBoris Johnson will chair an emergency Cobra meeting after the explosion outside a Liverpool hospital.Motivation for hospital blast not clear - policeEU to widen Belarus sanctions as border row growsA US culture war raging in BrazilA Nobel prize-winning economist's guide to cookingWhat Biden and Xi want from virtual summitThe robots behind the bar serving your next drinkThe Uyghur woman fighting to keep her culture alive.
