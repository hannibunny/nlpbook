Covid: Are booster jabs available for my age group?All over-40s in the UK will be offered a third dose of Covid vaccine, and 16 and 17-year-olds are to be given a second jab.The announcement has been made by the government's advisers, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).What are the new vaccine guidelines?Anyone aged 40 or over can now have a booster vaccine, once six months have passed since their second jab.Anyone aged 16 or 17 can now have a second jab, as long as it is 12 weeks since their first. A booster is an extra dose of Covid vaccine, which helps prolong protection in the double-jabbed, particularly in older age groups.Boosters have already been offered to anyone over-50, frontline medical staff and people with health conditions that put them at greater risk.Immunity against Covid-19 declines more quickly in older people than younger age groups, although protection against serious illness is still pretty high.Having three doses offers a 93% protection against symptomatic disease, according to UK Health Security Agency data from people aged 50 and over.If eligible, you can get the jab six months (182 days) since your second dose.One dose of Pfizer or a half-dose of Moderna will be offered as a booster, with both giving a good protection.The amended rules are the same throughout the UK:You can wait to be contacted for an appointment, or - depending on where you live - book online.In England, you can book your booster five months (152 days) after your second dose, either by appointment or at an NHS walk-in centre.An online booking portal has been launched in Scotland, and will soon be extended to people in their 40s. In Northern Ireland, appointments for over 50s and other eligible groups are available in pharmacies.Anyone who is entitled to a booster in Wales should wait for an appointment.Which children are being vaccinated?The JCVI said 16 and 17-year-olds should come forward for a second dose of the Pfizer jab - which should be given at least 12 weeks after the first.Meanwhile, all 12 to 15-year-olds in the UK are being offered a single Pfizer Covid jab.There is no vaccine currently approved for under-12s in the UK.How many people have now been vaccinated?About 50 million people aged over 12 in the UK have now had at least one dose of Covid vaccine. More than 46 million have had a second dose. More than 12.6 million people have now had a third jab. As well as boosters, some people with severely suppressed immune systems are being given a third primary jab as part of their basic vaccination - they may also be offered a booster at a later date.What are the vaccine rules for NHS staff?The government has announced that frontline NHS staff in England will have to be fully vaccinated against Covid by 1 April.There will be exemptions for medical reasons and for those who don't have face-to-face contact with patients.And care home staff in England had until Thursday 11 November to get vaccinated (unless they have a medical exemption).These announcements only apply to England.Vaccination is not compulsory for other people in the UK, although people who've had both doses don't need to self-isolate after contact with a positive case. Scotland and Wales also require Covid passports to enter some venues and events, as do a number of foreign countries. Booking a first or second vaccinePeople who are under 40 or pregnant are being offered Pfizer or Moderna rather than Oxford-AstraZeneca, because of a possible connection with extremely rare cases of blood clots.Under-18s are currently being offered Pfizer, although the Moderna vaccine has also been authorised for use in children.The booster will usually be either Pfizer or Moderna, regardless of which type was originally given. The most common ones include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea. They are part of the body's normal immune response to vaccines and tend to resolve within a day or two.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.There are extremely rare, but occasionally fatal, cases of people developing blood clots after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.
