Testing capacity was then too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.The red areas on the map below show the places currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.

While the uptake of first and second doses has dropped off there has been a steep rise in people having booster doses. More than 10 million of these doses have been administered in England so far. In Scotland, 1.1 million people have had their booster shot, while that figure is over 620,000 in Wales and it is more than 200,000 in Northern Ireland.However, some doctors and others involved in the booster programme have told the BBC they are concerned about the speed of the rollout.Daily deaths have risen recentlyThere were 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported on Sunday. Of those deaths, 51 were in England, six were in Wales, five in Northern Ireland and one in Scotland.England has seen the majority of UK deaths since the pandemic began, with more than 124,000 so far.   Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, has warned that "very high" coronavirus rates in the UK recently mean hard months are still to come.He told the BBC it was concerning that Covid levels were "running this hot, this early in the autumn season" and urged people to get their Covid jabs, boosters and flu vaccines.The most recent government figures show 8,652 people with coronavirus in hospital in the UK, down from 9,253 a week earlier. Although numbers of hospital patients with coronavirus are higher than they were over the summer, they are far below the peak of nearly 40,000 people back in January.Looking at Covid patients in hospital by region, the numbers are higher than in the summer and have been rising again recently in some regions. Death toll could be over 165,000When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways, each giving a slightly different number. First, government figures - the ones reported each day - count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. This figure is now more than 140,000.According to the latest ONS figures, the UK has now seen more than 165,000 deaths - that's all those deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The third measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was about 137,000 as of 29 October.In total, there were 12,631 deaths registered in the week to 29 October, which was 14% above the five-year average.Of the total deaths, 1,042 were related to coronavirus, 67 more than the previous week. There have been more deaths involving Covid than "excess" deaths since the start of the pandemic, meaning non-Covid deaths must be below usual levels. This could be down to the milder flu season last winter - due to less travel and more social distancing - and because some people who might have died for other reasons had there been no pandemic, died of Covid.The "R number" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. The latest R number estimate for England is 0.8 to 1.0, for Scotland it is 0.9 to 1.1, for Wales it is 0.8 to 1.1 and for Northern Ireland it is 0.95 to 1.1.Covid map: Where are cases the highest?How do I get my free Covid tests?Where do people still need to socially distance?Â© 2021 BBC.
