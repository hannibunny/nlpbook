Alta Fixsler: Toddler dies in hospice after parents' legal battle failsA seriously ill two-year-old girl whose parents wanted her to be at home at the end of her life has died in a hospice.Alta Fixsler, from Salford, suffered a brain injury at birth and died, surrounded by her family, on Monday.Earlier this month, her parents lost their legal battle against Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust for life support to be withdrawn at home rather than in hospital or a hospice.Her father told the BBC that Alta "was our whole world".A High Court judge had ruled her treatment should be withdrawn in a children's hospice.Her father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: "She passed away in a hospice on Monday. I don't know even how to explain how I am feeling."She fought for her life for three hours after the life support was turned off."He said the protracted court battle had been "very painful". "The trust would not let us take her home," he added.Following her brain injury at birth, Alta was left unable to breathe, drink or eat without medical help.The girl's parents, who are Hasidic Jews, previously lost their fight against the removal of life support. They had argued it was against their faith.Her father previously told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that taking her home was "something that we wanted from day one when the doctors said she is not going to live more than a few hours".Throughout the legal battle medics insisted Alta had no chance of recovery. High Court judge Mr Justice MacDonald also said her parents' idea of taking her abroad to Israel for alternative treatment would expose her to "further pain".He said ceasing life-sustaining treatment was in the toddler's "best interests" and moving her would cause her discomfort "for no medical benefit".Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?
