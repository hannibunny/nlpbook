Tories reverse decision to ban Covid families group from conferenceA Covid bereaved families group that has been highly critical of the prime minister has been told it can attend the Conservative conference after all.Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice was initially banned from the event in Manchester, without an explanation.But the group has now been told that the decision was due to an "error that has been subsequently reviewed".The Conservative Party has not officially commented on the ban - or the decision to reverse it.Earlier on Tuesday, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice said it was "shocked and frustrated" after it received a letter notifying it that its application to attend the Conservative Party conference had been rejected. "It defies belief that the party in government seems determined to not only ignore us, but have as little contact with us as possible," said a spokesman.The letter said the party did not comment on the reasons behind its decisions about individuals or groups. The group, which will be at Labour's conference in Brighton next week, has now been told it can attend the Tory conference the following week.The group's spokesperson Lobby Akinnola said: "The Conservative Party has just u-turned and decided that we can in fact attend their party conference. "Their initial decision to disallow bereaved families from attending was disgraceful, and we hope that there is a genuine acknowledgement of that and that they are prepared to work with us."Laughably, they've claimed the initial decision was 'an error'. Funny that the error wasn't spotted when we initially asked for an explanation for the decision, and only when the news broke in the media."Unfortunately it seems that we keep having to correct government 'errors', which is exactly why they need to start engaging with bereaved families and stop trying to avoid us." Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice was set up to represent those who have lost loved ones during the pandemic.It has been calling for a full public inquiry into the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis to happen immediately.Boris Johnson has promised to hold one "in due course" but says the immediate focus must be on recovering from the pandemic.The group says neither the prime minister nor any ministers have met them despite repeated requests.Labour calls for Covid public inquiry to start in June'Mistake' to discharge Covid patients says SturgeonBereaved Covid families ask for meeting with PMFrance and US seek to mend rift over Aukus pactThe deal caused outrage in France, which lost a contract to build submarines for Australia.Covid could be more like cold by spring - expertWhat will Germans miss about Angela Merkel?
