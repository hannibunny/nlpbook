U.K. Defense Ministry investigating email exposing Afghan interpreters seeking rescueMany are still in hiding in Afghanistan and hoping to get to BritainLONDON — Britain’s Defense Ministry is investigating a data breach that disclosed the email addresses of scores of Afghan interpreters who had worked with British forces and were looking for a way out of Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover.Many are still in hiding in Afghanistan and hoping to get to Britain, the BBC reported.The ministry apologized Tuesday for what Defense Secretary Ben Wallace called “an unacceptable breach.”“We apologize to everyone impacted by this breach and are working hard to ensure it does not happen again,” a ministry spokeswoman, who confirmed the investigation, said in response to questions from The Washington Post.More than 250 Afghans who needed help to relocate were mistakenly copied into an email from the ministry, reportedly revealing their names, email addresses and some of their pictures to all recipients.Many, though the exact number remains unclear, did not make it out in the massive operation — marked by violence, chaos and harrowing images — in which U.S. forces and their allies evacuated tens of thousands of foreigners and Afghans last month. Some Afghans who remained fear reprisal for working with Western forces during the 20-year war or for being involved in human rights work.While British jets airlifted about 15,000 people in a little over two weeks, the armed forces minister said Monday that it would “take some time for the dust to settle on exactly who is out” and who is not, but that the government was still working to help them.As NATO countries end Kabul airlift, many interpreters, embassy staffers and drivers are left behindThe mass email under scrutiny came from the team running relocations from Afghanistan, which was in touch with the interpreters after the Taliban seized control of the country last month.It warned the interpreters not to move if it wasn’t safe to do so and promised to help them, the BBC report said. In a second email half an hour later, the Defense Ministry asked recipients to urgently delete the last message and recommended that the interpreters change their email addresses.The ministry did not comment on the content of the email.Lawmakers in Britain urged the government on Tuesday to bring the Afghans to safety.“We told the Afghans who helped our British forces that we would keep them safe, but this data breach has needlessly put lives at risk,” said John Healey, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party and the shadow defense secretary.The chaotic evacuations from Afghanistan led to sharp criticism of British officials — chief among them Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary who was vacationing on a Greek island when the militants marched into Kabul. He was subsequently reassigned as justice minister. Raab also faced questions when British Embassy workers fleeing the capital left behind documents identifying Afghan staffers, who were later flown out of the country.U.K.’s top diplomat defends chaotic Afghan evacuation, citing intelligence failuresFormer veterans minister Johnny Mercer accused the government of “a criminally negligent performance” in its treatment of British allies left behind in Afghanistan.Another Conservative member of Parliament, Tobias Ellwood, who welcomed the probe into the email error, also called for a fast-track plan to get allies out in any way possible. “Each day they remain in the country, the risk of the Taliban catching up with them increases,” he said.The story of an Afghan man who fell from the skyAfter 20 years of warfare, Taliban fighters in Kabul miss the battleU.S. military admits ‘horrible mistake’ in strike that killed 10 AfghansThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
